# Season of AI - Season 2 - Copilots
### Oct 1 to Dec 31, 2024
This folder contains prepared "content-in-a-box" that anyone can use to do a technical talk on "Copilot" concepts at a user group, meetup, or community event. At the end of the "season", the content in this repo will be archived, and a new season of content will be published.

Each topic includes slides and presentation notes. Some will include pre-recorded demos and videos to help you prepare and/or present. Demo code will be available in separate repos linked from each presentation.
